# Tutorial Publication-Ready Figures
Plotting data is a fundamental part of research in almost every discipline. It’s also critical for communicating our research and creating engagement with it, especially because people often decide to read a manuscript based on the figures. Python is a powerful plotting tool but, with so many options and settings, it can be time consuming to work out how to make effective and attractive plots. This workshop is your cheat sheet for using the Python packages matplotlib and Seaborn to make static plots. The examples focus on plotting numeric and categorical data in x/y space, but many of the methods demonstrated apply to other kinds of plots. The workshop is interactive and uses Jupyter Notebooks. We assume some previous experience with Python but you’ll be able to do this workshop if you have imported a module, printed a statement, and made a basic plot. Detailed setup instructions will be provided prior to the workshop, along with a link to the course material. If you’re looking for a way to level-up your data visualizations and increase engagement with your research, then this workshop is for you.
